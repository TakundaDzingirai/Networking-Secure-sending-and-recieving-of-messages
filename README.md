# Simple Client-Server System

This system consists of a simple server that receives text from a client, converts it to uppercase, and sends it back.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Running the System

1. **Start the Server:**
   - Open a terminal.
   - Run `python server.py`.
   - The server will start and wait for connections.

2. **Run the Client:**
   - Open another terminal.
   - Run `python client.py`.
   - The client will send a message to the server and display the response.

Make sure to start the server before running the client to ensure the connection can be established.
